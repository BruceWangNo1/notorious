# Notorious
Hello everybody! Notorious aims to be a highy extensible tracker implemented in golang. Right now, Notorious uses Redis to store peer information for quick retrieval and to alleviate some of the burden of storing peer information from the tracker itself. Moreover, some of the core functionalities which Notorious hopes to gain include the following:
```
1. Improved ratio tracking using a SQL (using an ORM, so it's preference). 
2. IPV6 support
3. UDP & HTTPS tracking (only supports HTTP right now)
4. Speed and scalability are always in the back of my mind, even if my decisions don't always reflect that
5. Remove technical debt. I learned go from this project, so there's definitely non-idiomatic and idiotic code in places.
```

There's probably a lot more! Check out my [issues page](https://github.com/GrappigPanda/notorious/issues)

And here for what's planned to be in the next release: [Milestone 0.5.0](https://github.com/GrappigPanda/notorious/pull/139)

# Deployment

Deployment is one of the funnest things from this project for me so far because I've gotten to use a lot of cloud technologies which I typically wouldn't get to deal with. As of the moment, I'm using [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) and deploying to a 5 $ [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/39961c9b71bf) droplet. As you'll see, there's a dockerfile in my repo as well as a supervisord.conf and to build it, you'd want to run:
```
go build main.go
docker build -t notorious .
```
and then you can run
```
docker run <-d> -p 3000:3000 notorious (where the <> indicate the -d is optional, it starts it in daemon mode)
```
Et voil√†, you have a copy of notorious running,.

This will build the docker image which you can then run it either on local bare-metal, or if you're interested in the Docker Cloud route (which I highly recommend) head over to their [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/getting-started/) They'll explain deployment 1 000% better than I can.

## Please note:
I have not yet included instructions for running everything on bare-metal and I'm using docker because it just works (sorry, I try to keep the buzzwordiness down [despite deploying notorious with redis, docker, go...]), but those are soon to come. I just honestly thing the docker way is 10x (just like me, heh) easier to deploy with at this particular moment.

# Contact Notorious

Notorious is a project which I've had a ton of fun learning Go in, but do realize I'm still learning Go so I do make non-idiomatic decisions. If you see anywhere that you think I could improve my code or golang usage, please:
